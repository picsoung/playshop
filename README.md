Example play code for developers to use to get started with various API usage

As we move through the community trying to teach people about APIs, I've found that people understand the value of a single API but rarely "get" the magic that comes when combining different APIs together.  This repository has been built as a place for evangelists and other community leaders to place example code for "toys" that developers can download and use right off the bat.

Each different app should have a README with getting started instructions, including information on acquiring keys if appropriate.
